# xframes-rust

## Instructions

`cargo run`

## Notes

Just like with the Free Pascal demo app, passing `0` as `id` as integer causes the application to crash. Currently I am passing `0.0` as `id`, which is not ideal (and technically wrong). I need to find a solution.

## Screenshots

Ubuntu 24.04
